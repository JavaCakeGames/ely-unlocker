# ![](ico/32.png) Ely Unlocker

A very simple extension to unlock price pages on *RuneScape* price-tracking website ely.gg, without having to check their Discord server each day.

**As of the implementation of codes that rotate every 30 seconds, this extension no longer works.** Apologies for the inconvenience - I've unlisted it from the Chrome/Firefox stores. The best alternative I know of to Ely is https://flipaholics.pro/ but it may be worth keeping an eye on https://www.runestats.info/prices.
